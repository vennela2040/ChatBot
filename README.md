Introduction:
This project implements a simple chatbot using Java Swing, a GUI toolkit for Java.
The chatbot allows users to type messages, and it responds with predefined answers based on the user's input.
The chatbot recognizes specific keywords and phrases to generate appropriate responses. It provides a basic interaction experience between the user and the chatbot.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Implementation:
Technologies Used:
- Java
- Java Swing
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Features:
1. User Interface: The chatbot has a simple GUI consisting of a JTextArea for displaying the conversation, a JTextField for user input, and a JButton to send the messages.
2. Predefined Responses: The chatbot recognizes specific keywords and phrases in the user's input to generate predefined responses.
3. Dynamic Interaction: The chatbot dynamically responds to user input by appending the conversation to the JTextArea.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Limitations
- The chatbot's responses are limited to predefined keywords and phrases.
- The chatbot does not support natural language processing or advanced conversation handling.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Code Explanation

Class Structure
-Chatbot: This class extends JFrame and implements ActionListener. It represents the main chatbot application.

Fields
- JTextArea ca: Displays the conversation between the user and the chatbot.
- JTextField cf: Allows the user to input messages.
- JButton b: Sends the user's message to the chatbot.
- JLabel l: Represents the "SEND" label on the button.

Constructors
- Chatbot(): Initializes the JFrame, JTextArea, JTextField, and JButton. Sets up the GUI layout and adds action listeners.

Methods
- replyMeth(String s): Appends the chatbot's response to the JTextArea.

Event Handling
- actionPerformed(ActionEvent e): Handles the button click event. Processes the user's input, generates a response, and updates the JTextArea with the conversation.

GUI Configuration
- Sets the JFrame properties such as size, background color, and title.
- Configures the JTextArea, JTextField, and JButton with specific sizes, locations, and styles.

Conclusion
The Simple Chatbot in Java Swing provides a basic yet interactive chatbot experience for users.
 While it offers a straightforward way to communicate with the chatbot through predefined keywords and phrases,
 it lacks advanced features like natural language processing or learning capabilities. Future improvements could include integrating AI-based algorithms for more intelligent responses, adding user customization options, and enhancing the user interface for a more intuitive experience. Overall, this project serves as a foundational example of implementing a chatbot using Java Swing, which can be extended and improved upon for more advanced applications.
